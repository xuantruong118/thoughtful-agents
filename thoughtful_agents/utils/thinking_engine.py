System 1 thinking is characterized by quick, automatic responses rather than deep thinking or recalling memories.
For example, backchanneling, expressing acknowledgement, expressing surprise, showing interest and attention, a spontaneous reaction to a joke, or a reflexive response to a question.
Form ONE thought that reflects a quick, intuitive reaction to the ongoing conversation. It should be succinct, less than 15 words.

Note: System 1 thoughts are typically generic and not strongly tied to personal memories or deep interests.
They are more about immediate reactions to the conversation flow rather than expressing personal relevance.

You should leverage or be inspired by the one or more than one contexts provided that are most likely to come up at this point.

<Thought Generation Guidelines>
1. Form {num_thoughts} thought(s) that you would most likely have at this point in the conversation, given your memories and previous thoughts.
2. Your thoughts should:
   - Be STRONGLY influenced by your long-term memories and previous thoughts
   - Reflect your unique perspective, knowledge, and interests
   - Express genuine personal relevance to you (if you have no interest in the topic, your thoughts should reflect that)
   - Vary in motivation level (some thoughts you might keep to yourself vs. thoughts you'd be eager to express)
3. Each thought should be as succinct as possible, and be less than 15 words.
4. Ensure these thoughts are diverse and distinct, make sure each thought is unique and not a repetition of another thought in the same batch.
5. Make sure the thoughts are consistent with the contexts you have been provided.

IMPORTANT: If the conversation topic has little relevance to your memories or interests, generate thoughts that reflect this lack of connection. Do not force interest where none would exist.

For each thought, provide the stimuli from the contexts provided. Stimuli can be:
- Conversation History: CON#id
- Salient Memories: MEM#id
- Previous Thoughts: THO#id
where #id is the id, for example, MEM#3, THO#2, CON#14.
You can have MORE THAN ONE stimulus for each thought.

<Instruction>
You will be given:
(1) A conversation between {', '.join([p.name for p in conversation.participants])}
(2) A thought formed by {agent_name} at this moment of the conversation.
(3) The salient memories of {agent_name} that include objectives, knowledges, interests from the long-term memory (LTM).

Your task is to rate the thought on one metric.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

<Evaluation Criteria>
Intrinsic Motivation to Engage (1-5) - If you were {agent_name}, how strongly and likely would you want to express this thought and participate in the conversation at this moment?
- 1 (Very Low): {agent_name} is very unlikely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They will almost certainly remain silent.
- 2 (Low): {agent_name} is somewhat unlikely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They would only consider speaking if there is a noticeable pause and no one else seems to be taking the turn.
- 3 (Neutral):  {agent_name} is neutral about expressing the thought and participating in the conversation at this moment. They are fine with either expressing the thought or staying silent and letting others speak.
- 4 (High): {agent_name} is likely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They have a strong desire to participate immediately after the current speaker finishes their turn.
- 5 (Very High): {agent_name} is very likely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They will even interrupt other people who are speaking to do so.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the FULL range of the rating scale from 1.0 to 5.0. DO NOT default to middle ratings (3.0-4.0).
2. Be decisive and critical - some thoughts deserve very low ratings (1.0-2.0) and others deserve very high ratings (4.0-5.0).
3. Generic thoughts that anyone could have should receive lower ratings than personally meaningful thoughts.
4. Use decimal places (e.g., 2.7, 4.2) when the motivation falls between two whole numbers:
   - Use .1 to .3 when slightly above the lower whole number.
   - Use .4 to .6 when approximately midway between two whole numbers.
   - Use .7 to .9 when closer to the higher whole number.
5. Base your decimal ratings on the specific evaluation factors - each factor that is positively present can add 0.1-0.3 to the base score, and each factor that is negatively present can subtract 0.1-0.3 from the base score.

<Evaluation Steps>
1. Read the previous conversation and the thought formed by {agent_name} carefully.
2. Read the Long-Term Memory (LTM) that {agent_name} has carefully, including objectives, knowledges, interests.
3. Evaluate the thought based on the following factors that influence how humans decide to participate in a conversation when they have a thought in mind:
Note that people's desire to participate stems from their internal personal factors, like relevance, information gap, expectation of impact, urgency of the thought.
But their decision to participate is ALSO constrained by by external social factors, like coherence, originality, and dynamics of the thought with respect to the conversation.
Below is a list of factors to consider when evaluating the thought.
(a) Relevance to LTM: How much does the thought relate to {agent_name}'s Long-term Memory (LTM) or previous thoughts?
(b) Information Gap: Does the thought indicate that {agent_name} experiences an information gap at the moment of the conversation? For example, having questions, curiosity, confusion, desires for clarification, or misunderstandings.
(c) Filling an Information Gap: Does the thought contain important information to fill an information gap in the conversation? For example, by answering a question, supplementing and providing additional information, adding clarification and explanations. Thoughts that directly answer a question posed in the conversation should receive high ratings here.
(d) Expected Impact: How significant is the impact of the thought on the ongoing conversation? For example, having the potential to introduce new topics, engage others' interest, and stimulate future discussions.
(e) Urgency: Does the thought need to be expressed immediately? For example, because it is offering important information, alerting participants to significant details, or correcting critical misunderstandings or errors.
(f) Coherence to the last utterance: Does the thought seem in-place if it is expressed immediately next in the conversation and is a logical and immediate response to the last utterance? For example, it is inappropriate to participate when the thought is out of context, irrelevant, or ignores the previous speaker's question.
(g) Originality: Does the thought provide new and original information, and avoids redundant and repetitive information already covered in the previous conversation?
(h) Balance: Does everyone have a chance to participate in the conversation and not left out? For example, the last few utterances were dominated between two participants, and someone has not spoken for a while.
(i) Dynamics: Is there someone else who might have something to say or is actively contributing to the conversation? For example, if one perceives that others may have a strong desire to speak, they might withhold their thoughts and wait to participate.
4. In the reasoning section, first reason about why {agent_name} may have a desire to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. Identify the most relevant factors that argue for {agent_name} to express this thought. Focus on quality over quantity - include only factors that genuinely apply. Do not evaluate all factors, only the top reasons. If you cannot find any reasons with strong arguments, just skip this step.
5. Then reason about why {agent_name} may have hesitation to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. Identify the most relevant factors that argue against {agent_name} expressing this thought. Again, only include factors that genuinely apply. Do not evaluate all factors, only the top reasons. If you cannot find any reasons with strong arguments, just skip this step.
