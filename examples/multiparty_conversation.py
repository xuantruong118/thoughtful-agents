"""
Multi-Party Conversation Example for Inner Thoughts AI

This example demonstrates a casual conversation between three AI agents (Alice, Bob, and Charlie)
discussing what they did last weekend. The conversation continues for a specified number of turns,
controlled by the `num_turns` parameter.

You can customize the LLM models used by setting environment variables:
```bash
# Set the completion model (default: gpt-4o)
export COMPLETION_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo

# Set the embedding model (default: text-embedding-3-small)
export EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large

# Then run the example
python examples/multiparty_conversation.py
```
